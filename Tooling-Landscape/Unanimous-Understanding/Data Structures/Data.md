## Build environment description
Sometimes a description of the build environment, which was used to build the software product, is required. This data type implements this.
### Defintion 
#### Name
String
#### Version
String
#### Unique Identifier 
String (e.g. SHA Hash)
#### Text
textfield (the description itself)


## Constraint 
Contraints are requirements that have to be fulfilled. These are for example the obligations a license defines or constrains that products have to fulfill when they integrate other products. The design of an contstraint shall be in a way that a constraint can be defined in a specific company environment in accordance to the company specific poliy. On the other hand a constraint can also be made available via a publicly available resource

#### Type
Enumeration { Exception, Obligation, Permission Resctriction, Risk, Other }

#### Name
String
#### Description
textfield 
#### Scope
This defines the context of the constraint. E.g. in case a certain information is required when doing modifications of the software 
enumeration {distribution, modifications, usage, other}
