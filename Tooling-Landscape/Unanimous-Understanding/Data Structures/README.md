# Data Structures

Different kind of data are generated and consumed by the functional blocks, which comprise an end to end compliance tool chain.
All required data are presented here. This does not mean that every functional block has to deal with all data. These data structures shall be regarded as the "final" collection of all needed data and the functional blocks consume and/or generate the subsets of data they are aware of. If a certain implementation of the functional blocks in a specific workflow identifies the need of further implementation specific data they can be added as "specific data"

## Definitions
