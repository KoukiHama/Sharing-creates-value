# OSS Tooling Landscape - Unanimous Understanding

During the recent years, quite some OSS tools and initiatives have been started to help to manage OSS compliance. To structure the information about these better, we created the **OSS Tooling Landscape**. Our approach is to use modeling standards such as UML to provide an overview about
* the existing tools and initiatives
* their functional scope
* already implemented or potential integration scenarios.

The following is a brief description of the documents we have created.

## OSS Tooling Landscape

This diagram shows the main functional building blocks that companies typically have in their system / tools landscape for managing OSS compliance. These blocks do not represent concrete OSS tools, but depict logical fucntionalities that are required. However, concrete OSS tools and initiatives can be integrated into the landscape to visualize their functional scope, gaps and overlaps.

The tools landscape consist of
1. an UML component diagram 
2. a glossary that describes the functionality and scope of the different building blocks.

## Process flows

Based on the functional buidling blocks of the tooling landscape, process flows for dedicated process have been created as UML sequence diagrams.
