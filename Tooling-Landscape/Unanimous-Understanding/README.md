# OSS Tooling Landscape - Unanimous Understanding

During the recent years, quite some OSS tools and initiatives have been started that help to manage OSS compliance. To structure the information about these tools better, we created the **OSS Tooling Landscape**. Our approach is to use modeling standards such as UML to provide an overview about
* the existing tools and initiatives
* their functional scope
* already implemented or potential integration scenarios.

The following is a brief description of the documents we have created.

## OSS Tooling Landscape

This diagram shows the main functional building blocks that companies typically have in their system / tools landscape for managing OSS compliance. These blocks do not represent concrete OSS tools, but depict logical functionalities that are required. However, concrete OSS tools and initiatives can be integrated into the landscape to visualize their functional scope, gaps and overlaps. In fact, that'll be one of the next steps that we plan. If necessary, the logical building blocks will be adjusted.

The tools landscape consists of
1. a UML component diagram 
2. a glossary that describes the functionality and scope of the different building blocks.

## Process flows

Based on the functional building blocks of the tooling landscape, process flows for dedicated processes have been created as UML sequence diagrams. In future, we plan to create additional process flows. If necessary, the logical buidling blocks will be adjusted.
