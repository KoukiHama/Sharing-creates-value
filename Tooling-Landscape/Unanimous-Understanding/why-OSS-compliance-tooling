In former days compliance work was mainly the task of compliance officers and the legal departments. Compliance work was not really integrated in the sw development process, it was a parallel task that had only little connection to sw development often the compliance work done at a very late stage in product developement, which often caused delayed products.
In the aera of DevOps this approach has to be replaced by an approach where developers, compliance officers and lawyers work together as cross functional team or in other words the DevOps way of working has to be introduced in the compliance work - DevOps@compliance
