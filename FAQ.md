## What to contribute?
Everybody is invited to contribute any material, which will ease and / or reduce the efoort of OSS license compliance activities. a contribution can be a Debian copyright file, a SPDX document or any other "machine & human friendly" format of an OSS package analysis file.
Furhter contributions can be:
* A license text found in the internetwhich is not yet part of FOSSology
* A license analysis (rights / restrictions / obligations)
* Clarifications with OSS projects 
* Collaboration with OSS projects to "ease" SS license compliance
* Further material, e.g. "OSS disclosure documents"
* Software or tools, such as SPDX comparison or analysis tools
* Export Control and Customs (ECC) classifications, license exception TSU (Technology and Software Unrestricted)
* and any other material which makes live in OSS compliance easier.
If you represent a company and you do consider to contribute material, we do not interpret the material which is contributed as an indicator of the maturity of the established processes.

## How to contribute?
Like any other state of the art OSS project, we need a prove that all information / tools / documents /or any other contributions are contributed with the right and allowance to do so.
We need a Certificate of Origin. This does not imply relevant additional efforts; for example, every Linux kernel developer is familiar with this approach. Please understand that we cannot accept and make any contribution available via our sites which are not accompanied by the certificate of origin.

## How about liability?
One of the main questions or concerns which might hinder either the use or the contribution of OSS package analysis files is the question whether we or the contributor will be liable if there is a mistake in such a file. 
In order to answer this fundamental question we asked for legal advice. The following is the summary of the legal advice in our words:
Assuming that those files are protected by copyright they need to be licensed so that they can be used. We license the files under CC0 1.0 which is very near to "public domain" to make the use to them as easy as possible. Furthermore, the files can be downloaded and used ‘free of charge’.
These documents are so to say a donation. For donations there is liability only in case of willfulness or in a case of gross negligence. The process how the files are generated and which tools are used is described. Therefore, it can be reviewed and the tools can be evaluated. Moreover, the persons who process the tool output do have several years of experience in this area. We think that the risk of being liable is very little.

## Can I rely on the content of the license analysis files?
This question depends on your point of view, whether you trust this project and whether you think that the way how the files are generated is suited to provide accurate and reliable information.
We think that the process is defined in a way that following it will result in high quality information; nevertheless there is always the possibility that a used tool misses information or the person who processes the tool output makes a mistake. If you identify an error we are happy if you file an issue so that we are able to fix it.
