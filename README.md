## Sharing-creates-value
This project realizes the idea that Open Source Software (OSS) compliance activities will be less expensive by applying OSS principles.
## Introduction
Free and OSS development has a long and successful history. Its success is based on transparency, sharing, collaboration and appreciation. Open Source Software is _the_ success story of the last 30 years. Although the Open Source developement model and the Open Source values have inspired many different areas, like Open Data, Open Hardware, and many others, it is not really present in the area of Open Source license compliance. 

## Objective
Sharing creates value strives for the goal to lower the required effort in license compliance work for all who want to make use of OSS in a license compliant way. To achieve this Sharing creates value targets different areas.

## Our areas of work 
* OSS license compliance tooling, i.e. Open Source tools and their combination to form an highly automated end to end compliance toolchainto be intergated in the CI/CD tools
* Good practises in the area of OSS license compliance
* OSS license compliance artifacts
* Licenses found in the internet, in order to improve the efficiecy of recognizing licenses of a tool as well as having a collection of license texts available (it is not meant to be a competition to the SPDX license list)
* Descriptions of OSS license compliance procedures
* Any other material which eases the OSS license compliance activities

We want to be the platform, which provides all information and artifacts for OSS license compliance. We think that there are a lot good things already available and we want to serve as a place where this information can be shared. Everybody is invited to contribute whatever he/she wants to contribute, for more details please see the FAQs.

## What is the difference to other OSS license compliance activities
There exist already some projects / activities which deal with OSS license compliance like
* [OpenChain](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openchain/start) 
* [Open Compliance Program](https://compliance.linuxfoundation.org/)
* [Copyleft.org](https://copyleft.org/)
* [Open Source License Checklists by OSADL eG](https://www.osadl.org/Open-Source-License-Checklists.oss-compliance-lists.0.html)
* [Open Source License Compliance Handbook](https://github.com/finos-osr/OSLC-handbook) provided by [FINOS Foundation}(https://www.finos.org/)
* [ClearlyDefined](https://docs.clearlydefined.io/)

Another initiative, which is very helpful for the topic license compliance is the [Reuse](https://reuse.software/) project run by the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/)


OpenChain identifies the key requirements of a quality open source compliance program in its specification. The OpenChain Curriculum supports this process by providing extensive reference material for effective open source training and management. OpenChain Conformance allows organizations to show they meet these requirements. The topic "how do I comply with a specific license" is not addressed. 

Copyleft.org provides practical tips for complying with GNU licesnes. It does not provide any license information and copyright notices of OSS packages. 

The Open Source License Checklists was launched with the goal to create generally accepted checklists of the obligations of commonly used Open Source software that are accepted by distributors and copyright holders and trusted by all members of the distribution chain.

The Open Source License Compliance Handbook provides information on how to comply with some of the more common open source licenses under a specific set of use-cases in both a machine-readable and human-readable format. The goal here is to provide developers and engineers with some "self-serve" information to facilitate the end goal of open source license compliance, as well as identifying some of the more complex open source license compliance aspects for which consultation with open source counsel may be recommended.

One objective of this project to provide reviewed license and copyright information of OSS packages - ready to use for everybody under a very relaxed license. Thus making OSS compliance for everybody a low effort and easy task. We are aware that the best approach will be to upstream this information, but before one is able to upstream anything there is the task to create the information to be contributed upstream. This is one focus of this project.

It seems that ClearlyDefined targets this to a certain extent, too.
