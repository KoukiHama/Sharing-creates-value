# Sharing-creates-value
This repo realizes the idea that OSS compliance activities will be less expensive by applying OSS principles
## Introduction
Free and Open Source Software development has a long and successful history. Its success is based on transperancy, sharing, collaboration and appreciation. OSS and its developement model outperform traditional software development models. Althoug OSS is _the_ success story of the last 30 years, it is not yet there where it could be. One of the main reasons is the perception that OSS license compliance is a tedious, time consuming and high effort task. another main reason is the misperception that using OSS requires you to "open" your code to the world.
## Objective
Sharing creates value targets the first perception and strive for the goal to lower the required effort for all who want to make use of OSS in a license compliant way. To achieve this we will develop, share and improve the artifacts needed to fulfill the requirements of the different Free and Open Source Software licenses by applying the Open Source Software development principles. This will turn Open Source license compliance into a straight forward task. As a consequence, it will increase the adoption of Free and Open Source Software tremendously.
Another objective of Sharing creates value is a very close collaboration with the OSS community in order to fix detected "bugs" in licensing as well as introducing the information needed for license compliance activities in the Open Source projects, i.e. provide our analysis work to the OSS projects.
Last but not least we support tools which will help you to automate and reduce you effort in component management, license identification, OSS license compliance activities.
