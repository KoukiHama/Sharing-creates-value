#Developer
The developer represents actually all participants who are primaryly interested in the compliance topic from the (IT) technical perspective. This must not necesarily be a developer role but might also be a designer or writer. 

##Responsibilities, tasks and role
The ```primary goal``` of this role should be to provide software at a minimum technical and legal risk. 

Thus this role will be ```accountable``` for:
* Take care, that no third party copyright will be removed or changed
* Completeness of components listed in Bill of materials
* Alert, if/that legal circumstances are about to change (e.g. new usage scenario)

This typically results in the following ```tasks```: 
* Ensure (automated) build processes will be integrated with a scanning solution
* Prepare audit readyness of applied open source components
* Change or fix components as requested by PO role
* Provide understanding of compliance requirements (e.g. from OS policy)
* Provide understanding of challenges of contributing to OS projects
* Provide upstream feedback / support / contributions accoding to contribution policy
* Support OS audits

Therefor the most critical ```success factors``` are:
* Understanding of Open Source Policy (and awareness of it)
* Communication skill to convince team members of keeping the repository clean

The role requires a strong acceptance and standing in the team as compliance must not always be the most confortable way. (It's not a choice, it's just good manufacturing practise) Also the complexity of the tasks will highly depend on the degree of automation the tool chain has achieved. The will escalate to either PO or Compliance Manager.

In a real life scenario, this role would be taken by a:
* Senior Software Developer
* Software Architect
