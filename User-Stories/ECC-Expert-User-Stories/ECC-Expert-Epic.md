## ECC Expert Epic 
 A ECC expert (export control and customs) might be a lawyer or a special trained person in export control regulations who cares about all export control classifications for applications which are delivered that include OSS and/or other third party software.

## Responsibilites, tasks and role 
As an ECC expert I am responsible to ensure the proper ECC classification of applications and advise the product owner and the development staff in a way that applications can be made available in the target markets in compliance with the existing ECC regulations. This comprise analysis of the integrated third party packages no matter whether this is OSS or commercial software in the context of export control.


## Epic

As an ECC expert I always need a complete overview of the in an application integrated third party software. In order to achieve my tasks I need information about every package whether it
* has already a ECC classification and if yes which classification it is
* whether it contains cryptography and if so for which purpose the algorithms are used ( e.g. authentication or encrypting communication) and the key length 
* whether it is OSS meaning that it is publicly avialable
* whether it was modified by the own development staff and if so whether the cases are made publicly available in case of OSS
* the origin of the package 

having all this information available for every package which is integrated in the application and having the same information of the application itself enables me to do the proper classification. Furthermore I can do if neccessary based on the entire bill of materials a "de minimis" calculation. Having always an accurate and up to date view of the integrated third party packages enables me to warn the product owner and the development staff in a timely manner in case the resulting ECC classifiaction will not allow the application to be made available in a certain traget market, so that the product owner and the development staff have enough time to react before the application is going to be launched.
